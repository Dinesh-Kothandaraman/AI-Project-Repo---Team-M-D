**Human Activity Recognition**

Implementing Human Activity Recognition for jail activity on Videos captured by the surveillance camera using CNN-LSTM in TensorFlow. 

**Objective**
The primary objective is to develop an AI system capable of recognizing human actions in videos. This includes identifying and categorizing actions such as “Fighting“, “Shooting“, and “Stabbing" from video footage captured in the jail surveillance Camera .

**Approach**
The project aims to leverage TensorFlow and its Keras API to construct a CNN-LSTM architecture for human activity recognition in videos. This involves preprocessing video data by extracting frames, normalizing pixel values, and generating sequences. The CNN layers will be designed and configured to extract spatial features from video frames, while LSTM layers will capture temporal dependencies and sequence information. Training will involve batch processing, dropout, and optimization techniques like the Adam optimizer to enhance model performance. Evaluation will be conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in recognizing human activities accurately.
